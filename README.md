# Header Parser API
https://api.iabrahamson.com/parser

## About
This was one of the first API's that I built. It uses Node and Express.js to create a simple REST API that returns a JSON document with the sender's header information.

## Usage

`GET /`: Parses request's header and sends JSON response.
